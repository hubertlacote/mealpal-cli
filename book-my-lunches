#/ Sample script that shows how to use mealpal-cli to book a schedule of
#/ lunches specified in the script, e.g.:
#/ - on Monday, book Meal A or Meal B if Meal A is not available,
#/ - on Wednesday, book Meal C or Meal B or Meal D...
#/
#/ Can be interrupted safely and executed in the middle of a schedule.
#/
#/ Instructions:
#/
#/ - Replace YOUR_COOKIE_FROM_CHROME_HERE with your mealpal session cookie.
#/ - Edit the meals you want to book and execute this script every two weeks
#/   by specifying with -s, the date of the first Monday of the schedule
#/   specified in the script.
#/
#/ Usage:
#/
#/ @PROGRAM@ -c <mealpal_cookie> -s <start_date>
#/
#/      -c <mealpal_cookie>     MealPal session cookie (see README.md)
#/      -s <start_date>         Date of the first Monday of the schedule
#/
#/ Example:
#/
#/     # Exact starting date
#/     @PROGRAM@ -c "YOUR_COOKIE_FROM_CHROME_HERE" -s "2019-01-21"
#/
#/     # Monday in 2 weeks (Next Monday + 1 week):
#/     @PROGRAM@ -c "YOUR_COOKIE_FROM_CHROME_HERE" -s "Monday + 1 week"
